#ABOUT THE PROJECT
A Project based on my compiled experience in React Js. -A Food and Cocktail WebApp-

After building about 15 mini-projects, i went ahead to formulate a much bigger project that contains everything I learnt in the mini-projects. From the design stage to the final product, everything was built from scratch by me. It took about 3 weeks to finally complete this project. 3 weeks of unstable electricity, research upon research and finally, the output. 

Here is a link to the live demo of the project:

Some Major things to note about the project include:
1. Context Api - used to prevent prop drilling and manage both state and functionality
2. Redux - used for managing multiple linked states and was especially used for the message component
3. There are multiple Api requests
4. The Checkout button utilizes stripe-payment-infrastructure
